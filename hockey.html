      <b>Hockey </b>is a term used to denote various types of both summer and
      winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of
      ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. There are many types of hockey.
      Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others
      do not. In order to help make the distinction between these various games,
      the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey",
      "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey". In each
      of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre
      the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into
      the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two notable exceptions use a
      straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a "puck") with a
      hole in the center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey
      whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's
      Sam Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified in
      roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable
      for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. The
      floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true
      variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off
      of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in
      Canada in 1963. Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian
      who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936.

      HOW TO PLAY?
    </h5>
    <p>
      The game begins with a toss where both captains are present. One of them
      calls it correctly and gets the choice to pass first or choose a
      particular end of the field; just like the toss in other games. The game
      is played for 75 minutes that includes a five minute half-time interval.
      Both sessions are played for 35 minutes each. The time is paused in
      between the game for substitutions, treatment for injury, etc., and then
      resumes.
