      <b>Football </b>is a family of team sports that involve, to varying
      degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football
      normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
      word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football
      (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football
      (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules
      football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These
      various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are
      known as football codes. There are a number of references to traditional,
      ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the
      world.

    <h5>
      HOW TO PLAY?
    </h5>
    <p>
      A football match begins with the toss of coin. The match referee and the
      two captains meet at the center of the field. The captain of the team who
      wins the toss gets to decide which goalpost to attack in the first half,
      while the team that loses the toss gets to kick-off to begin the match.
      The players take position in their own half of the field. The ball is
      placed at the center point of the field. Once the referee blows the
      whistle, a player from the team that lost the toss takes the kick-off, and
      the ball moves forward. This player cannot touch the ball again till any
      other player from either team touches the ball. During the second half,
      the teams switch goals and the team that won the toss gets to kick-off.
